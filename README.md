# theta (Î¸)
Monolithic IA-32 kernel that acts as a graphing calculator. Notable features:
- Supports SSE
- Graphing calculator,
- Solving for `x` in any equation $ax^2 + bx + c$,
- and more!

# Compiling

## Dependencies
You will need:
- An [i386-elf](https://gist.github.com/pedrominicz/93ef0510a20f990b8dc99877fd51a438) toolchain.
- GRUB development dependencies:
  - xorriso
  - mtools
  - `grub-pc-bin` (if you're booting UEFI and on Ubuntu)

## Compilation

### Building the kernel ELF
You can just run `make`. The Makefile is designed to both:
1. Compile the stub and kernel
2. Bail out (and don't continue) if either compilation of the stub or kernel
failed.
```
$ make
```

### Building an ISO file
The `build_iso.sh` file is here to build the iso. As mentioned earlier,
this is where you need the GRUB development dependencies:
```sh
# You can also do bash build_iso.sh
$ ./build_iso.sh
...
$ file theta.iso
theta.iso: ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data (DOS/MBR boot sector) 'ISOIMAGE' (bootable)
```

# Running

## Emulation
For this, you'll need qemu (or other emulator - like Bochs). The flags I
personally use for development are:
```
-d int -M smm=off -monitor stdio -m 256
```

The full command would be
```
qemu-system-i386 -d int -M smm=off -monitor stdio -m 256 -cdrom theta.iso
```

## Real Hardware
What I like to do is clear out the partitions on the USB device with `cfdisk`, for example
```sh
# I boot off an NVMe drive, so this doesn't damage my system -- this
# may be different for you.
$ sudo cfdisk /dev/sda
# Here we remove all the partitions and write to disk and quit
$ sync # Just make sure the filesystem is up to date
$ dd if=theta.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M && sync
```

Now, you should be able to boot off the USB device.
# Credit/Acknowledgements

I would like to credit [bzt](https://gitlab.com/bztsrc) for:
1. The ssfn library
2. The font provided
3. The `writestring` function.

# Contribution
To contribute to theta, all you need to do is:
1. fork the repository
2. make your changes
3. open a pull request when you're done.

That's it! I don't care if you use semantic commit messages or not.
The only thing I do ask of you is that every commit is compilable. E.g.
you can revert to a specific commit and everything will compile smoothly.

# Support
If you like my work, and would like to support me, you can donate to me.
